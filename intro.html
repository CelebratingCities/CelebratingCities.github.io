                DOT continues to help Americans reach opportunity by ensuring that America’s transportation system
                provides reliable, safe, and affordable ways for people to reach jobs, education, and other essential

                Uber creates possibilities for riders, drivers, and cities. For the women and men who drive with Uber,
                the Uber app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, Uber helps strengthen local
                economies, improves access to transportation, and makes streets safer. We believe that when
                transportation is as reliable as running water, everyone benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Transportation projects can ensure reliable, safe, and affordable access to jobs, education, and other
                essential services. But that isn’t happening for everyone. For example, a New York University Rudin
                Center for Transportation study compared neighborhoods by accessibility to mass transit and the number
                of jobs within an hour’s commute. It found that areas with some, but insufficient, access to
                transportation — had the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest incomes. On the other hand,
                residents of areas well-served by transit or who could rely on personal vehicles had reasonable access
                to opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theme of this hackathon is therefore: Celebrating Cities: Connecting the People of Baltimore,
                Maryland, and DC with Opportunity through Transportation.

            <h4><b>Catalyze neighborhood revitalization in underserved urban areas</b></h4>
            <p>
                Focus on the area near the West Baltimore MARC Station, where existing transportation access provides
                a good starting point for neighborhood revitalization. Using Federal data sets in combination with
                local data sets, show how the West Baltimore MARC station provides access to jobs, job training,
                quality education, and other services. Describe relevant demographics like unemployment, income level,
                and car ownership in the surrounding neighborhood. Using the Uber Development Platform, demonstrate how
                accessing Uber services might increase the connectivity of this area. Compare the cost and time profiles
                for use of Uber services in combination with transit against the Location Affordability Index for the
                same area.

                difficult to obtain convenient, affordable and safe access to these services in underserved areas.
                Using the Uber Developer Platform, develop compelling applications with easy-to-use features, services,
                and tools that can help bridge that gap. Incorporate non-transportation information, like public safety
                (crime) and access to quality schools.

                differing ethnic groups and income levels. Connect these data sets with Federal data sets about ethnic
                and demographic profiles to show which communities might benefit from increased transportation options.
